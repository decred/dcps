==Abstract==

A Decred Change Proposal, or DCP for short, is a design document that describes
potential consensus changes to Decred.  Due to Decred's decentralized governance
structure, any proposed changes to consensus require super-majority stakeholder
approval via the integrated on-chain proof-of-stake voting infrastructure.
Consequently, DCPs primarily serve for documentation, fostering
cross-implementation compatibility, and helping ensure proper engineering rigor
is followed.

Prior to putting a consensus change to an on-chain vote, the proposed change
must first be accompanied by a DCP as described in this document along with
providing a working and tested implementation, and the rule change must be gated
behind a voting agenda which ensures the stakeholders are provided with the
opportunity to vote to accept or reject the change.

It is important to note that DCPs are the end result of a process that begins
with the Decred off-chain proposal and voting system,
[[https://proposals.decred.org/|Politeia]], which deals with more generalized
proposal submissions.  It is through that system that all initial proposals for
consensus changes are brought to life, undergo collaboration, and are subject to
an initial community vote to determine if the work necessary to create a working
implementation, its associated DCP, and an on-chain vote for the rule change
should be performed.

==Formatting Specification==

All DCPs must be written using the mediawiki format, and, where relevant, should
be comprised of the sections detailed in this specification.

===Header Preamble===

Every DCP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble with the headers in
the following order.  Headers marked with an asterisk (*) are optional.  All
other headers are required.

<pre>
  DCP: <DCP number, or "?" before being assigned>
  Title: <DCP title; maximum 44 characters>
  Author: <list of author names and email addresses>
  Status: <Defined | Voting | Locked In | Active | Failed | Replaced | Obsolete>
  Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
  License: CC0-1.0
* License-Code: <abbreviation for source code under different approved license(s)>
* Requires: <DCP number(s)>
* Replaces: <DCP number>
* Superseded-By: <DCP number>
</pre>

The '''Author''' header lists the names and email addresses of all the
authors/owners of the proposal.  The format of the '''Author''' header value
must be:

  Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

Multiple authors must be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line
conventions.

The '''Status''' header specifies the current status of the DCP as described in
the [[#Status|status]] section.

The '''Created''' header records the date that the DCP was assigned a number.
Dates must be in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format, e.g. 2017-05-04.

The '''License''' and '''License-Code''' headers must use approved licenses as
defined in the [[#Licensing|licensing]] section.

DCPs may have a '''Requires''' header, indicating the DCP number(s) that the
current one depends on.

DCPs may also have a '''Superseded-By''' header indicating that a DCP has
been rendered obsolete by a newer version.  The value is the number of the DCP
that replaces the current one.  The newer DCP must have a '''Replaces''' header
containing the number of the DCP that it renders obsolete.

===Standard Sections===

The following sections are standard and thus should typically be included with
all DCPs.  There are some instances where some of the sections might not apply.

====Abstract====

The abstract section provides a short overview of the proposal.  It is required
for all DCPs.

====Motivation====

The motivation section explains in detail what the proposal addresses and why
it is necessary.  This section is critical and required for all consensus change
proposals since consensus changes, in particular, must not be made lightly.

Consensus changes typically involve updates to a wide amount of software across
the entire ecosystem and, at the very least, require stakeholder participation
in the form of education and voting.  In short, consensus changes often require
the extremely valuable commodities of time and attention from everyone in the
ecosystem and, as such, must have a compelling motivation.

====Specification====

The specification precisely describes the semantics of the proposal.  In
particular, it must be detailed enough to foster multiple interoperable
implementations of Decred software.

It is important to consider the implications of cross-platform compatibility
when providing a specification since it is also critical to achieve the
aforementioned goal of fostering multiple implementations.

For example, floating point math often produces slightly different results
between programming languages due to issues such as rounding errors and
uncertainty in their respective libraries.  Consequently, integer math is
generally preferred.

Another example is that the precision of regular integers in some languages may
vary depending on the architecture (e.g 32-bit versus 64-bit).  Specifications
must consider these differences and ensure they are adequately defined.

Moreover, consensus code must strive to actively avoid 3rd-party dependencies
since other projects often have very different, and less strict, requirements
than what is required by consensus code.

====Rationale====

The rationale section provides insight into the final design laid out in the
specification.  It should include topics such as why particular design decisions
were made, theory of operation, alternate designs, and other related work.

This section, like the motivation section, is also critical and required for
consensus change proposals.  Stakeholders need to make an informed decision on
any new rules introduced to the network and the rationale for choosing a
particular design is a key consideration.

Keep in mind that fully validating nodes will be responsible for enforcing any
rules set forth by the proposal and archival nodes will effectively have to
enforce the rules ''forever''.

====Deployment====

The deployment section provides details related to how the proposal will be
deployed to the network.

As mentioned in [[#Abstract|Abstract]] section of this document, all consensus
changes must make use of a voting agenda.

The voting agenda definition should be of the following form:

=====Voting Agenda Params=====

{|
!Name!!Setting
|-
|Deployment Version||''version''
|-
|Agenda ID||''short, descriptive agenda id''
|-
|Agenda Description||''description of the agenda''
|-
|Start Time||''unix timestamp (human-readable date)''
|-
|Expire Time||''unix timestamp (human-readable date)''
|-
|Mask||''agenda mask in hex that defines which bits are used (Bits #, #, ...)''
|-
|Choices||{|
!Choice!!English Description!!Bits
|-
|abstain||''short description of the choice''||0x00
|-
|no||''short description of the choice''||''value of choice in hex (Bit #)''
|-
|option 1||''short description of the choice''||''value of choice in hex (Bit #)''
|-
|option 2||''short description of the choice''||''value of choice in hex (Bit #)''
|}
|}

Additionally, once the voting has completed, whether the vote passed or failed,
a voting results section should be added and be of the following form:

=====Voting Results=====

This proposal was approved/rejected by the stakeholder voting process and is now
active/failed.

{|
!Status!!Block Hash!!Block Height
|-
|Voting Started||''hash of the block''||''height of the block''
|-
|Locked In (only if vote was successful)||''hash of the block''||''height of the block''
|-
|Active or Failed||''hash of the block''||''height of the block''
|}

====Compatibility====

The compatibility section is recommended for all proposals and is required for
any proposals that introduce backwards incompatibilities.  In general, this
section should discuss exactly how the proposal affects existing software.

A proposal that is backwards compatible should specifically state that, along
with an explanation of why it is backwards compatible.

A proposal that is '''not''' backwards compatible must also provide a plan for
handling the incompatibilities.

====Reference Implementation====

The reference implementation section is required for all consensus change
proposals since, due to Decred's decentralized governance structure, all
proposals which involve changes to consensus must undergo a voting agenda which
implies that proposals must also already have a working, tested, and
well-documented implementation that lies dormant in the code and therefore can
be activated should the change be accepted by the stakeholders.

====Test Vectors====

The test vectors section applies to any proposals that introduce facets that can
reasonably be independently tested and serves to help multiple implementations
ensure they are compatible.  Some examples where test vectors might reasonably
be included are new algorithms, new standard script types, smart contracts,
additional script opcodes, and changes to the block or transaction structure or
hash generation.

====Acknowledgements====

The acknowledgements section provides a standard mechanism for giving
recognition.  This might include citing contributors and collaborators who
provided direct technical assistance, participated in intellectual discussions,
or otherwise provided assistance with the proposal.

This section also should be used to cite relevant source material as needed.

Acknowledgements that are not directly related to the proposal, such as personal
encouragement, should '''not''' be included.

====Copyright====

All DCPs must be licensed under the terms set forth in the [[#Licensing|Licensing]]
section.

===Other Sections===

In addition to the [[#Standard_Sections|standard sections]], the DCP may contain
any other sections that the author feels are relevant to the proposal.  For
example, some proposals may wish to contain supplemental data such as simulation
results, examples, footnotes, and future extensions.

==Status==

===Specification===

The status of a DCP is primarily defined by the on-chain voting system.  There
are two additional status indicators intended to allow clear DCP status
signaling in case future updates replace or obsolete a given DCP.

The following chart shows the progression of a DCP according to the voting
process:

<img src="./dcp_status.png" />

DCPs which involve a consensus change automatically progress to the '''Voting''',
'''Locked In''', '''Active''' or '''Failed''' status depending on the result of
the associated on-chain vote.

It is also possible for the semantics defined by a DCP to be replaced or
rendered obsolete by a newer DCP.  In that case, the status may become
'''Replaced''' or '''Obsolete'''.

===Rationale===

One of the most important features of Decred is its democratic handling of
potentially controversial consensus changes via its decentralized, transparent,
cryptographically-secured, on-chain voting system.  This means that whether or
not a given consensus change proposal progresses to an '''Active''' or
'''Failed''' status is entirely based on the results of the on-chain vote.

There are no additional status indicators for things such a drafts and
withdrawals since all DCPs are only created as the result of an off-chain
proposal and voting system that deals with those issues has already been
completed.

==Licensing==

===Specification===

====DCP Text====

New DCPs are required to be licensed with the
[https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0 CC0-1.0: Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal]
license and must declare this by setting the '''License''' header in the
[[#Header_Preamble|preamble]] to its abbreviation, '''CC0-1.0'''.

====Source Code====

The source code in the DCP may optionally be licensed using a separate license
per the following list.  The separate code license must be declared by setting
the '''License-Code''' header in the [[#Header_Preamble|preamble]] to its
abbreviation.

* ISC: [https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC ISC License]
* BSD-2-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license]
* BSD-3-Clause: [https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license]

The recommended license for source code is '''ISC'''.

===Rationale===

It is important for DCPs to be licensed under the most permissive terms possible
since they will become technical reference documents that are an intrinsic part
of Decred.  This is also why code licenses such as the GPL are not acceptable.

While it might be tempting to simply allow DCPs to placed into the public domain
directly, it is disallowed due to its controversial legal status.  The public
domain is not universally recognized as a legally sanctioned entity, so some
argue that "granting" a work into the public domain has no legal effect
whatsoever.
