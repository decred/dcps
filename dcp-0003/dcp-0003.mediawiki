==Abstract==

This repurposes the sequence field of transaction inputs to provide
consensus-enforced relative lock-time semantics, specifies a new opcode
(<code>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code>) for the Decred script system that provides
the ability to conditionally enforce relative time-based restrictions, and
changes the semantics for transaction time locks to use the median time of the
previous 11 blocks instead of the timestamp of the block itself in order to
ensure the lock times increase monotonically with each block.

==Motivation==

There are a large number of use cases that either rely on, or can benefit from,
the ability to prevent spending outputs until they have reached a certain
relative age, especially when that ability can be conditionally enforced via the
script system.  A few examples of these use cases are provided in this proposal,
but it is important to note that they are merely a small sampling of the
possible applications.

Currently, the ability to lock outputs until a certain absolute age exists via
the locktime field of transactions and the <code>CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY</code>
opcode.  In other words, that opcode makes it possible to conditionally enforce
that an output can't be spent until a specific time and date, or a specific
absolute block height.

In comparison, this proposal aims to additionally provide consensus-enforced
''relative'' time locks.  In other words, the ability to allow a transaction
input to remain invalid until a certain number of blocks or time has passed from
the point the referenced output is actually mined.

The sequence field of transaction inputs was inherited from Bitcoin where its
original intent seemed to be to support replacing unmined transactions by
increasing the sequence number.  Unfortunately, that approach would not work
well because it relies on miners benevolently choosing the higher value even
when it would go against their best interests such as preferring a lower
sequence number that paid a higher fee and therefore it has never been used.

Consequently, this proposal repurposes the sequence field to provide the
highly desirable relative lock-time properties in a backwards-compatible way
while still providing some additional bits for future enhancements.

===Hash Time-Locked Contracts with Relative Timeouts===

The basic premise of Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) are described in
[[https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki|DCP0002]],
which also provides an example HTLC that relies on absolute lock times by making
use of the <code>CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY</code> opcode.  With the new
<code>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> opcode in this proposal, it is possible to
modify the example contract slightly such that the timeout is relative to the
time the contract is actually mined into the chain as follows:

    OP_IF
      OP_SHA256 <hash of secret> OP_EQUALVERIFY           // Require disclosure of secret to redeem
      OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <counterparty2 public key hash>   // Require signature from counterparty 2
    OP_ELSE
      <locktime> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP           // Prevent redemption until specified relative timeout after funding
      OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <counterparty1 public key hash>   // Require signature from counterparty 1
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG                            // Ensure signature is valid

This is useful because it allows these contracts to be negotiated off-chain
without imposing an absolute deadline by which they have to be recreated with a
timeout further in the future.  This is the case because, due to the relative
timeout, the clock does not start ticking until the transaction is actually
mined into the chain.

===Bidirectional Payment Channels===

A fundamental requirement of the Lightning Network (LN) is what is known as a
bidirectional payment channel.  In essence, a bidirectional payment channel is a
series of off-chain transactions that are constructed in a way that allows them
to take advantage of the security of normal on-chain transactions while
simultaneously providing several additional benefits.

At a high level, this is accomplished by creating an on-chain anchor transaction
that requires signatures from both counterparties to redeem and a series of
time-locked revocable commitment transactions that spend from that anchor
transaction.  Each party initially creates a commitment transaction that refunds
their respective individual amounts they used to fund the contract, however,
they do not broadcast them to the network.  Instead, as they conduct business,
they create new commitment transactions which alter how the funds are split
between them.  Since the anchor transaction can only be spent once, and due to
the restrictions enforced by the underlying smart contract, only the most recent
commitment transaction is valid.  Consequently, the payment channel can be
trustlessly closed at any time by either party by simply broadcasting the
most recent commitment transaction to the network for inclusion in the
blockchain.

Since the commitment transactions are time locked, using absolute times would
effectively place a lifetime on the channel.  This is the case because it
would be necessary to close and reopen the channel any time the absolute timeout
was approaching in order to prevent the counterparty from being able to steal
funds.  This also implies that it would be necessary to use fairly long timeouts
with absolute time locks in order to limit the frequency of closing and
reopening channels.  Long timeouts are not desirable because it increases the
time it takes to recover funds from the channel in the event of an uncooperative
counterparty.

These problems can all be avoided by using relative time locks.

===Lightning Network===

The Lightning Network further builds on the concept of bidirectional payment
channels to create a network of them over which payments can be trustlessly
routed by finding a path similar to the way packets are routed through the
internet.  In order to do this, it essentially makes use of HTLCs with
decrementing time locks.

===Off-chain Atomic Swaps===

Combining the concepts of bidirectional payment channels, routing over multiple
hops, and techniques to perform cross-chain atomic swaps, such as those
described in [[https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki|DCP0002]],
it is possible to instantly and trustlessly exchange funds between chains with
heterogeneous consensus rules so long as both chains support a shared
cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256.

In short, off-chain atomic swaps provide the opportunity to create instant,
trustless, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

===Escrow with Timeout===

A common technique when making payments for products or services via an escrow
is to create a 2-of-3 multisig transaction between the buyer, seller, and a
third-party escrow agent.  In this type of setup, the escrow agent acts as an
arbiter in the event the transaction does not go smoothly, but is not able to
unilaterally steal the funds.

The addition of the proposed <code>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> opcode allows an
additional relative time constraint to be added such that the original funding
party can redeem the funds after a timeout without needing to get the escrow
agent or seller involved.  The timeout does not start ticking until the contract
is actually funded.

An example contract which accomplishes this follows:

    OP_IF
      OP_2                                        // Require 2 signatures...
      <buyer public key>
      <seller public key>
      <escrow public key>
      OP_3                                        // ...from the 3 pubkeys
      OP_CHECKMULTISIG                            // Ensure required number of signatures are valid
    OP_ELSE
      <locktime> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP   // Prevent redemption until specified relative timeout after funding
      <buyer public key> OP_CHECKSIG              // Require signature from buyer
    OP_ENDIF

==Specification==

===Transaction Lock Times Based On Past Median Time===

All calculations involving transaction lock times MUST be compared against the
timestamp of the median time of the previous 11 blocks.  This value is also
often called the past median time and is already used in various places in the
consensus code.

This requirement includes changing the semantics of the existing lock time field
and also applies to the newly repurposed relative lock-time sequence numbers
described in this proposal.

===Relative Lock-time Sequence Numbers===

Transactions with a version greater than or equal to 2, except for coinbase and
stakebase transactions, are required to interpret the sequence number of their
inputs per the following diagram and detailed specification:

<img src="sequence_num.svg" width="100%" height="75" />

{|
!Bits!!Description
|-
|0-15|||Relative lock time.  This value is interpreted differently depending
on the type flag.  A mask of 0x0000ffff MUST be applied to the sequence number
to extract this value.
|-
|16-21||Reserved for potential future use
|-
|22|||Relative lock type.  When set, the value portion MUST be interpreted as
the relative number of blocks required.  When ''not'' set, the value portion
MUST be interpreted as the number of 512-second intervals required.
|-
|23-30||Reserved for potential future use
|-
|31||Disable flag.  When set, the sequence number MUST not have any new
consensus-enforced meaning, as described in this proposal, applied to it.
|}

Time-based constraints MUST be encoded with a granularity of 512.  Since 512
is 2^9, this implies converting the number of seconds to and from the value
portion of a sequence number can be accomplished by shifting the value right or
left 9 bits, respectively.

Relative locks MUST provide a minimum constraint on the age of the input
relative to the referenced output.  The constraint is either a block-time
constraint in terms of seconds or a block-height constraint in terms of number
of blocks depending on the type of the relative lock as determined by bit 22 of
the sequence number.  Since the sequence number is a 32-bit value, this implies
a mask of <code>0x00400000</code> may be be used in conjunction with the binary
AND and binary OR operations to determine or set the relative lock type,
respectively.

The age of an input MUST be calculated relative to the output that is being
spent.  For time-based relative locks, the age is relative to the past median
time of the block prior to the one that contains the output, while, for
block-based relative locks, the age is relative to the height of the block that
contains the output.

The previous two rules imply that a relative lock time of 0 (in terms of both
seconds and number of blocks) indicates an input can be included in any block
and any other values prevent an input from being included before the required
age has been reached.

It should also be noted that bit 22, the relative lock type flag, is the high
order bit in a 3-byte signed integer as encoded when pushed as data in the
Decred scripting language for use with the proposed
<code>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> opcode.

===CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY Opcode Value===

The new opcode <code>CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> redefines the existing opcode
<code>NOP3</code>, which has a value of <code>0xb2</code> (<code>178</code>
decimal).

===CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY Opcode Semantics===

When executed, the script execution MUST terminate with an error under the
following conditions:

* The stack is empty; or
* The top stack item is encoded with more than 5 bytes; or
* The top stack item is less than 0; or
* The top stack item does not have the disable flag set; and
** The transaction version is less than 2; or
** The transaction sequence number has the disable flag set; or
** The transaction sequence number and top stack item relative lock-time types are not the same; or
** The top stack item is greater than the converted transaction sequence number

Otherwise, the opcode MUST be treated as a NOP.


The following diagram illustrates these semantics:

<img src="op_csv.svg" width="100%" height="650" />

This opcode, in conjunction with the newly introduced requirements imposed on
sequence numbers in the relative lock-time sequence numbers section, provides a
mechanism to conditionally ensure that a minimum age has been reached before a
transaction can be included in a block.

==Rationale==

The format of the sequence numbers and semantics of the opcode were chosen
because they mirror those used in other prominent chains and therefore provide a
much easier path to allowing interoperability with other chains.

This is especially pertinent since the ability to trustlessly interoperate helps
pave the way for techniques such as off-chain atomic swaps and a whole host of
other use cases which can make use of these primitives.

==Deployment==

This agenda will be deployed to mainnet using the standard Decred on-chain
voting infrastructure as follows:

|}
|}

==Compatibility==

This is a soft-forking change to the Decred consensus, so old nodes that have
not been upgraded will continue to follow the chain with the most proof-of-work.

However, it is highly recommended that all nodes upgrade before the activation
time so they also fully validate and enforce the new rules versus relying on
upgraded nodes to do so for them.

The only use of sequence numbers currently is to disable checking the lock time
constraints and that behavior is not changed by this proposal.

Other software that performs full validation will need to upgrade their script
system and consensus enforcement rules according to the specification herein.

//   - bit 22 is the relative lock type (unset = block height, set = seconds)
//   - the next 6 bites are reserved
//   - the least significant 16 bits represent the value
//     - value has a granularity of 512 when interpreted as seconds (bit 22 set)
