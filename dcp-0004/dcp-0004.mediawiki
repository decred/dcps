==Abstract==

This proposes required corrections to the view that is used to enforce relative
time locks in order to provide full support for the Lightning Network and a wide
variety of other use cases.

==Motivation==

The current view used for determining consensus-enforced relative lock-time
semantics in version 2 transactions is more restrictive than called for by the
original specification in [[../dcp-0003/dcp-0003.mediawiki|DCP0003]].  As a
result, it is currently not possible for applications to make full use of their
functionality.

This proposal modifies the consensus rules to ensure their full functionality is
available.

As a reminder, a small sampling of some of the possible applications that
relative locks enable include:

* Lightning Network
* Hash Time-Locked Contracts with Relative Timeouts
* Bidirectional Payment Channels
* Off-chain Atomic Swaps
* Escrow with Timeout

See [[../dcp-0003/dcp-0003.mediawiki|DCP0003]] for more information about these
applications.

==Specification==

The view which is used to provide inputs necessary to determine sequence lock
calculations for transactions with sequence locks enabled must provide access to
the referenced inputs so long as those inputs exist from the point of view of
the block from which the sequence locks are being evaluated.

Recall that sequence locks are only enabled for inputs on transactions that are
not coinbase or stakebase transactions, have a version greater than or equal to
2, and do not have the disable flag set in the sequence number field.

For reference, the disable flag is bit 31 of the sequence number field as
shown in the following diagram:

<img src="../dcp-0003/sequence_num.svg" width="100%" height="75" />

In particular, transaction inputs with sequence locks enabled that are currently
rejected by the current consensus rules must be permitted when appearing in
transactions that exhibit the following properties:

* The transaction appears in the regular tree and spends outputs from transactions which appear earlier in the same block
* The transaction spends outputs from blocks before the block prior to the current block
* The transaction spends outputs from a transaction shared between the current block and the block prior to it when the block has been disapproved

==Rationale==

The specific approach of implementing the necessary updates such that they apply
to existing version 2 transactions was chosen for three primary reasons:

* It significantly reduces the number of changes other software needs to make as compared to other approaches such as introducing a new transaction version
* It provides a cleaner future upgrade path as it will allow the legacy view handling code to be completely removed once the changes specified herein are activated and the activation height is buried sufficiently deep in the chain history
* It supports more efficient view implementations which act solely on unspent outputs versus pruned transactions

More generally, there is a strong preference for changes which do not require
permanently carrying around legacy baggage that ultimately can't be fixed.  The
proposed implementation satisfies that goal.

==Deployment==

This agenda will be deployed to mainnet using the standard Decred on-chain
voting infrastructure as follows:

|-
|yes||change to the new consensus rules||0x04 (Bit 2)
|}
|}

==Compatibility==

This is a hard-forking change to the Decred consensus.  This means that once
the agenda is voted in and becomes locked in, anybody running code that fully
validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time or they will risk
rejecting a chain containing a transaction that is invalid under the old rules.

Other software that performs full validation will need to modify their consensus
enforcement rules accordingly.  Since the changes introduced herein are less
restrictive than the previous sequence lock rules, and therefore there will not
be any transactions in the chain which do not conform to the newly activated
rules, new implementations will not require any additional code to handle the
previous more restrictive rules.

==Reference Implementation==

<source lang="go">
// Only create and use a view which preserves the expected consensus
// semantics for relative lock times via sequence numbers until DCP0004
// becomes active.
legacySeqLockView := expectedView
fixSeqLocksActive, err := b.isFixSeqLocksAgendaActive(node.parent)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
if lnFeaturesActive && !fixSeqLocksActive {
	var err error
	legacySeqLockView, err = b.createLegacySeqLockView(block, parent, view)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
}
</source>
