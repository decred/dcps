==Abstract==

This specifies modifications to the block reward subsidy split such that 10%
goes to Proof-of-Work (PoW) and 80% goes to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).  The Treasury
subsidy remains at 10%.

==Motivation==

This proposal is motivated by an extensive analysis that shows the majority of
the PoW hash power is highly centralized and being used to maliciously
manipulate Decred markets.

The proposed modification to the subsidy split is intended to substantially
diminish the ability to attack Decred's markets with mined coins and improve
decentralization of the issuance process.

See the [[https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4|Politeia proposal]]
for further details.

==Specification==

===Integer Math===

In order to facilitate better compatibility across implementations and languages,
the formulas defined by the specification make use of integer math instead of
floating point math as denoted by the use of the floor function.  This is highly
desirable for consensus code since floating point math can be problematic across
languages due to issues such as rounding errors and uncertainty in their
respective libraries.

===Full Block Subsidy Formula===

The calculated full subsidy for each block MUST remain the same as it is prior
to this specification.  Since calculation of the modified subsidy proportions
for PoW and PoS relies on first calculating the full subsidy, the details of the
existing calculation are also provided in this specification.

<!--S_{full}(h) = \begin{cases}0 & \text{if } h \le 0,\\P & \text{if } h = 1,\\f(\left\lfloor\frac{h}{I}\right\rfloor) & \text{if } h > 1,\end{cases}-->
<!--f(x) = \begin{cases}c_{0} & \text{if } x = 0,\\\left\lfloor\frac{f(x-1) \times R_{m}}{R_{d}}\right\rfloor & \text{if } x \ge 1,\\\end{cases}-->
<img src="full_block_subsidy.svg" width="100%" height="279" />

Explanation of terms:

S<sub>full</sub> = The full block subsidy at a given height<br />
h = The height for which the full subsidy is to be calculated<br />
P = The coins generated by the first block (1,680,000 X 10<sup>8</sup> on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />
I = The number of blocks in the subsidy reduction interval (6144 on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />
c<sub>0</sub> = The base coin subsidy before any reductions (3,119,582,664 on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />
R<sub>m</sub> = The coin subsidy reduction multiplier (100 on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />
R<sub>d</sub> = The coin subsidy reduction divisor (101 on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />

===Modified Subsidy Split===

The subsidy split for the full block subsidy MUST be split between Proof-of-Work
(PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and the decentralized Treasury as follows:

* PoW - 10%
* PoS - 80%
* Treasury - 10% (no change from existing)

Additionally, the resulting PoS subsidy MUST be split evenly between the maximum
number of votes per block, which, as of this specification, is 5 on all
networks.

The Treasury subsidy proportion MUST remain the same and otherwise retain all
existing semantics it has prior to this specification.

The following formulas precisely specify the calculations for the modified
subsidy splits for arbitrary heights.  This ensures the semantics are fully
specified for all heights; however, it is important to note that they MUST
only be applied to <code>mainnet</code>, and current <code>testnet</code>, for
heights where the new rules are active per the associated on-chain vote.

<!--S_{pow}(h,v) & = & \begin{cases}0 & \text{if } h \le 0,\\S_{full}(1) & \text{if } h = 1,\\\left\lfloor\frac{S_{full}(h) \times 1}{10}\right\rfloor & \text{if } 2 \le h < H_{sv},\\0 & \text{if } h \ge H_{sv} \textbf{ and } v < v_{m},\\\left\lfloor\frac{\left\lfloor\frac{S_{full}(h) \times 1}{10}\right\rfloor \times v}{v_{b}}\right\rfloor & \text{if } h \ge H_{sv} \textbf{ and } v \ge v_{m},\end{cases}-->
<!--S_{vote}(h) & = & \begin{cases}0 & \text{if } 0 \le x < H_{sv}-1,\\\left\lfloor\frac{S_{full}(h) \times 8}{10 \times v_{b} }\right\rfloor & \text{if } x \ge H_{sv}-1,\end{cases}-->
<img src="subsidy_proportions.svg" width="100%" height="464" />

Explanation of terms:

S<sub>full</sub> = The full block subsidy at a given height<br />
S<sub>pow</sub> = The subsidy for proof of work at a given height for a given number of votes<br />
S<sub>vote</sub> = The subsidy for a single vote at a given height<br />
h = The height for which the subsidy is to be calculated<br />
v = The number of votes included in the block<br />
H<sub>sv</sub> = The height at which stake validation begins (4096 on <code>mainnet</code>)<br />
v<sub>b</sub> = The number of votes per block (5 on all networks)<br />
v<sub>m</sub> = The minimum number of required votes (3 on all networks)<br />

===Subsidy Enforcement===

IMPORTANT: The PoS subsidy, and hence each individual vote subsidy, is based on
the block PRIOR to the one that contains the vote since that prior block is the
one being voted on.  In practice, this means the formula to calculate the vote
subsidy MUST be called with a height of one less than the PoW subsidy formula
once the height that voting begins at is reached.

The following modified rules MUST be enforced:

* The input value of the one and only input of the coinbase transaction MUST commit to the modified PoW subsidy proportion
* The total of the output values of the coinbase transaction MUST NOT exceed the modified PoW subsidy proportion plus the total fees from all transactions contained in the block
* The input value of the stakebase of vote transactions MUST commit to the modified single vote subsidy proportion
* The proportional payouts of vote transactions MUST be calculated based on the modified single vote subsidy proportion
* The total of the output values of vote transactions MUST NOT exceed modified single vote subsidy proportion

====Coinbase Rules and DCP0006 Requirement====

The rule regarding the total of the output values of the coinbase transaction
takes into account that DCP0006<ref>[[../dcp-0006/dcp-0006.mediawiki|DCP0006]]</ref>
is already active.

==Rationale==

Proof of Work is intended to provide several key properties to Decred, some of
which are:

* Unambiguous determination of the exact contents of a block
* Unforgeable historical timestamps
* A source of entropy
* Significantly increased cost to conduct a wide variety of attacks
* Protection against data manipulation and double spends
* Fair coin distribution

While PoW has worked well for almost all of these properties, unfortunately
extensive analysis has shown that the expected results of a fair coin
distribution has not been achieved.

A commonly overlooked aspect of PoW mining is that it has to behave similarly to
gold mining in order for it to achieve the expected results of a fair coin
distribution.  That is the reason the process is referred to as mining.

More concretely, the price is expected to track the cost of production such
that, as the profitability goes up, the incentives for competition also go up
which leads to more participants (hash power) and thus profitability reduces
accordingly.

That expected result has not happened in Decred, which has led to Decred
significantly overpaying for what PoW provides, as evidenced by the relative
stability in overall network hashrate throughout long periods of large (e.g.
10-20x) changes in the exchange rate.  The consequence of that has been a high
degree of centralization of the coins.

The most expedient approach to deal with Decred overpaying for PoW is to simply
reduce the PoW subsidy from 60% to 10% of the block subsidy.

This way, Decred retains the positive parts of PoW, like it being an entropy
source and providing unforgeable costliness and irreversibility, without
requiring substantial consensus work.

===Alternative Approaches===

Some other approaches that were considered and deemed unsuitable at the current
time are:

'''Change the PoW algorithm'''

* It does not solve the underlying issue of Decred overpaying for PoW
* It would require 6-12 months of research and debate to do properly
* The same issue is likely to emerge with any new algorithm due to the first point

'''Switch to pure PoS'''

* This would require deep consensus changes and take 12+ months to execute
* There are several attack vectors present with pure PoS that are difficult to solve

'''Compete on ASICs'''

* High risk, high cost, and high lead time
* Competing with existing manufacturers requires substantial capital expenditures in the 10s of millions of USD
* Existing manufacturers have a massive advantage due to industry expertise, existing infrastructure, and backroom deals

==Deployment==

This agenda will be deployed to mainnet using the standard Decred on-chain
voting infrastructure as follows:

|}

==Compatibility==

This is a hard-forking change to the Decred consensus.  This means that once
the agenda is voted in and becomes locked in, anybody running code that fully
validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time or they will reject
all blocks containing transactions with payouts that conform to the new
subsidy split since they are invalid under the old rules.

Other software that performs full validation will need to modify their consensus
enforcement rules accordingly and any software that creates coinbases or votes
will need to be updated to handle the changes specified herein.

==Reference Implementation==

The following implementations are simplified versions intended to clearly
illustrate the exact semantics of this specification with self-contained
functions.  See the linked pull request for the full implementations that
include optimizations and the ability to selectively calculate both the legacy
subsidy proportions as well as the new ones defined herein.

===Full Block Subsidy Calculation===

<pre>
// calcBlockSubsidy returns the max potential subsidy for a block at the
// provided height.  This value is reduced over time based on the height and
// then split proportionally between PoW, PoS, and the Treasury.
func calcBlockSubsidy(height int64) int64 {
	// These parameters are ordinarily unique per chain and thus should be
	// passed into the function via a chain parameters structure, however,
	// they are defined as constants with the mainnet parameters here for the
	// purposes of providing a self-contained function for the DCP.
	const (
		mainnetBlockOneSubsidy            = 1680000 * 100000000
		mainnetSubsidyReductionInterval   = 6144
		mainnetBaseSubsidy                = 3119582664
		mainnetSubsidyReductionMultiplier = 100
		mainnetSubsidyReductionDivisor    = 101
	)

	// Negative block heights are invalid and produce no subsidy.
	// Block 0 is the genesis block and produces no subsidy.
	// Block 1 subsidy is special as it is used for initial token distribution.
	switch {
	case height <= 0:
		return 0
	case height == 1:
		return mainnetBlockOneSubsidy
	}

	// Calculate the subsidy by applying the appropriate number of reductions
	// per the requested height.
	reductions := height / mainnetSubsidyReductionInterval
	subsidy := int64(mainnetBaseSubsidy)
	for i := int64(0); i < reductions; i++ {
		subsidy *= mainnetSubsidyReductionMultiplier
		subsidy /= mainnetSubsidyReductionDivisor

		// Stop once no further reduction is possible.  This ensures a bounded
		// computation for large requested intervals and that all future
		// requests for intervals at or after the final reduction interval
		// return 0 without recalculating.
		if subsidy == 0 {
			break
		}
	}
	return subsidy
}
</pre>

===Work (PoW) Proportion Subsidy Calculation===

<pre>
// calcWorkSubsidyDCP0010 returns the proof of work subsidy for a block at the
// provided height and given number of votes using the modified subsidy split.
func calcWorkSubsidyDCP0010(height int64, voters uint16) int64 {
	// These parameters are ordinarily unique per chain and thus should be
	// passed into the function via a chain parameters structure, however,
	// they are defined as constants with the mainnet parameters here for the
	// purposes of providing a self-contained function for the DCP.
	const (
		mainnetStakeValidationHeight = 4096
		votesPerBlock                = 5
		minVotesRequired             = (votesPerBlock / 2) + 1
	)

	// The first block has special subsidy rules.
	if height == 1 {
		return calcBlockSubsidy(height)
	}

	// The subsidy is zero if there are not enough voters once voting begins.  A
	// block without enough voters will fail to validate anyway.
	if height >= mainnetStakeValidationHeight && voters < minVotesRequired {
		return 0
	}

	// Calculate the full block subsidy and reduce it according to the PoW
	// proportion.
	const proportion = 1
	const totalProportions = 10
	subsidy := calcBlockSubsidy(height)
	subsidy *= proportion
	subsidy /= totalProportions

	// Ignore any potential subsidy reductions due to the number of votes prior
	// to the point voting begins.
	if height < mainnetStakeValidationHeight {
		return subsidy
	}

	// Adjust for the number of voters.
	return (int64(voters) * subsidy) / votesPerBlock
}
</pre>

===Stake Vote (PoS) Proportion Subsidy Calculation===

<pre>
// calcStakeVoteSubsidyDCP0010 returns the subsidy for a single stake vote for a
// block at the provided height using the modified subsidy split.
func calcStakeVoteSubsidyDCP0010(height int64) int64 {
	// These parameters are ordinarily unique per chain and thus should be
	// passed into the function via a chain parameters structure, however,
	// they are defined as constants with the mainnet parameters here for the
	// purposes of providing a self-contained function for the DCP.
	const (
		mainnetStakeValidationHeight = 4096
		votesPerBlock                = 5
		minVotesRequired             = (votesPerBlock / 2) + 1
	)

	// Votes have no subsidy prior to the point voting begins.  The minus one
	// accounts for the fact that vote subsidy are, based on the height that is
	// being voted on as opposed to the block in which they are included.
	if height < mainnetStakeValidationHeight-1 {
		return 0
	}

	// Calculate the full block subsidy and reduce it according to the stake
	// proportion.  Then divide it by the number of votes per block to arrive
	// at the amount per vote.
	const proportion = 8
	const totalProportions = 10
	subsidy := calcBlockSubsidy(height)
	subsidy *= proportion
	subsidy /= (totalProportions * votesPerBlock)

	return subsidy
}
</pre>
